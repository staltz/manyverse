This index.ts file declares the Cycle.js components for each screen, the drivers used, and the initial layout shown when starting the app.

The libraries.ts file is automatically generated (so please don't edit it directly) and lists all the open source libraries that are a direct dependency in Manyverse. This is necessary for the screen "libraries" which will list all these dependencies and link to their respective LICENSES and webpages.
