This is code for a "Web Worker" in React Native which has access to all the APIs that the Main JS thread has, but not the nodejs-mobile APIs.

The purpose of this worker is to offload some work that could be done on the main JS thread, but is heavy enough to negatively affect UI interactions and animations. For instance, the *muxrpc* client for the nodejs-mobile process could do some crypto hash verifications or decoding. Even if lightweight, these workloads can affect UI performance, so we put them in this worker.

This worker communicates with the Main JS Thread over using `multiserver-worker`, `pull-worker`, `muxrpc`. Basically it allows the Main JS thread to talk to this worker in the same way the Main JS Thread would talk to the nodejs-mobile process.

See `/tools/build-worker-android` to understand how this gets integrated with the app.
